# tic_tac_toe
First program in class. Tic-tac-toe in text form

Using custom definitions and logic loops to contol the flow.

Here is what should happen:

-game opens with a welcome menu
-asks for the name and piece selection for player 1, saves these as global variables.
-ask player 2 for their name only, saves this as a global variable.
-introduces the players to the game rules and prints the empty game board with the numbers 1-9 for each of the 9 cells.
-starts game using "while not endProgram:" (endProgram= False), this starts the actual meat and bones.
-prints the board and asks the first player for their move, checks that is a legal move
-repeat until their is a winner, testing this after each move
-once the game concludes the players can quit or play again
